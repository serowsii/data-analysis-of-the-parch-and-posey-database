Being a beginner means your favorite person would be a search engine in our case (google). you get to see how different people tackled the parch and posey database.
This way we had an insight of it being a business and giving it a business analytics approach.
I may not be able to share all the queries but I will share a few just give an insight on how we achieved the visualization part.


1. the channel that brought the highest number of customers

Ans Direct is the channel that brought the highest number of sales


SELECT COUNT(W.channel) AS countchannel, W.channel AS channel, A.name      
FROM accounts AS A
JOIN web_events AS W ON W.account_id = account_id
WHERE W.channel IN ('adwords', 'facebook', 'twitter', 'banner', 'direct', 'organic')
GROUP BY W.channel, A.name
ORDER BY countchannel DESC
LIMIT 6;

2.Total number of papers ordered according to region

SELECT region_id,
       COUNT(standard_qty) AS count_standard_qty,
       COUNT(gloss_qty) AS count_gloss_qty,
       COUNT(poster_qty) AS count_poster_qty
FROM orders
JOIN accounts ON orders.account_id = accounts.id
JOIN sales_reps ON sales_reps.id = accounts.sales_rep_id
GROUP BY region_id
ORDER BY region_id;

3.This query shows the region with  the highest sales in 2016 stating the sales reps and their names


SELECT date_part('year',occurred_at), accounts.sales_rep_id, accounts.sales_rep_id, accounts.name, sales_reps.name, region.name, total, total_amt_usd
FROM orders
LEFT JOIN accounts
ON orders.account_id=accounts.id
JOIN sales_reps
ON sales_reps.id=accounts.sales_rep_id
JOIN region
ON region.id=sales_reps.region_id
WHERE date_part('year',occurred_at)=2016
AND total_amt_usd >0
ORDER BY total_amt_usd desc
LIMIT 1;

# data-analysis-of-the-parch-and-posey-database
started my journey in data analysis and what better way to document
this was a group work and a our focus on learning was to understand SQL better using POSTGRESQL
each of us came up with queries from the database and analyzed them.
Visualization (my fav part tbh), because you get to see data, statistics and your analysis come to life.
